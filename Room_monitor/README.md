# Indoor temperature and humidity

Outdoor weather data can be easily available via various apps and online weather data portabls but how about indoor weather conditions? So, my desire to know the room temperature inspired me to take on this project. 

## Components used
1. RaspberryPi Pico Zero
2. DHT11 (temperature and humidity) sensor
3. 1.3 inch OLED display

## Aditional info
Normal ssd1306 library does not support 1.3 inch OLED display. Hence, sh1106 library was used instead. The following documentation was used as a reference.
